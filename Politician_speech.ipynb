torch police postThe incident took place in a village in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district.Police officials denied allegations of inaction on the local police’s part and said an accused has been arrested.It is suspected that the girl was sexually assaulted.The post-mortem report is awaited to confirm this, police said.According to the girl’s family, she had gone to a coaching centre on Friday afternoon.When she did not return home, the family searched for her but to no avail.They then approached the police to report her missing.The local police, however, directed them to file a complaint at another police station, the family alleged.When the girl’s body was found in a nearby pond on Friday night, tensions escalated in the area.On Saturday morning, an agitated crowd gathered around the local police station with brooms, sticks and bamboos.A Sub-Divisional Police Officer was gheraoed.Villagers vandalised the police outpost and set it on fire, resulting in several important documents getting destroyed.The police eventually resorted to baton charge to disperse the crowd.“So far, one person has been arrested.It remains to be seen if anyone else is involved.Efforts are underway to normalise the situation in the area.That is our priority,” a senior police officer said.Asked about the allegations of negligence against the police, he added, “We have identified and arrested the accused and he has admitted to the crime.We have taken each step and acted promptly.Still if people have allegations, we will surely look into those as well,” he added.The incident has triggered a political tussle, with the Opposition parties hitting out at the Trinamool Congress government.“They did not take the complaint seriously.It is Devi Paksha and at such a time, a daughter

Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on Aug. 9.The female doctor had gone to the lecture hall to rest during a night shift when she was attacked.An autopsy confirmed sexual assault and multiple injuries sustained before she died, suggesting she resisted and may have been tortured before being murdered.The Kolkata Police arrested a volunteer member of the force on Aug. 10 and have charged him with rape and murder, but the brutality of the case has drawn nationwide outrage, with medics across the country demanding safer workplaces and citizens demanding safety for women in a country with a shameful record of rape.Doctors at public hospitals across India refused to work last week, turning away all but emergency patients as part of a national strike over the rape and murder.Kolkata police had turned the city into a virtual fortress ahead of Tuesday\\\\\\'s planned protest, barricading all roads leading to the state secretariat and deploying 6,000 personnel in full riot gear.The police said they had not given permission for the protest march, and the Trinamool Congress party, which is in power in West Bengal state, alleged that it was an attempt by opposition parties to create unrest in the city.Police clashed with the protesters Tuesday morning as some of the crowd managed to climb over the barricades, but the demonstrators were stopped before they could reach the state secretariat.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is the opposition in West Bengal, claimed several students were injured Tuesday amid the clashes with the police and called for a new, 12-hour general strike in the state on Wednesday to protest the response.India\\\\\\'s federal Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), which was tasked with investigating the rape-murder in Kolkata, subjected the prime suspect, Sanjay Roy, to a polygraph test last week, the results of which were yet to be released Tuesday.Many in the country hope the results will shed new light on whether other people could have been involved in the attack, as has been suggested by the victim\\\\\\'s father.India reported an average of nearly 90 rapes per day in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the National Crime Records Bureau.Experts believe the real number could be much higher, as many rapes go unreported due to prevailing stigmas around sexual violence and a lack of faith in police investigations.Conviction rates remain low, with many cases becoming mired for years in India\\\\\\'s overwhelmed criminal justice system.On 9 August 2024, a 31-year-old female [postgraduate trainee doctor](/wiki/Medical_education_in_India#Postgraduate_Education \\\\\"Medical education in India\\\\\")[[4]](#cite_note-Independent-1608-4) at [R.
